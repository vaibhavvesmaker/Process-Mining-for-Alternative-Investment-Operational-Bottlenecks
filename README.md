# Process Mining for Alternative Investment Operational Bottlenecks

This repository documents a comprehensive project that applies process mining techniques to identify and resolve operational bottlenecks in alternative investment workflows – specifically focusing on the capital call process. The project demonstrates how data-driven insights, combined with process redesign and Robotic Process Automation (RPA), can reduce processing times and improve investor satisfaction.
This repo also educates about iCapitals business initiatives and their vision of improving the operational efficiency of their process and leveraging growth in alternative investment marketplace.

## Introduction

Alternative investment operations often rely on complex, manual processes for trade settlement and document workflows. These processes can lead to inefficiencies, unclear team handoffs, and delays in capital call processing. This project leverages process mining to analyze historical data, map the current process, and identify areas for improvement.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:**  
  Identify inefficiencies in trade settlement and document workflows within the alternative investment process – with a focus on capital call processing.

- **Situation:**  
  At CoreCentrica, the capital call process took 5 days due to unclear handoffs between teams.

- **Approach:**  
  1. **Data Collection:** Extract timestamps and task logs using SQL.
  2. **Process Mining:** Visualize and analyze process flows using tools like Celonis or Power BI.
  3. **Workflow Redesign:** Redesign the process to clarify responsibilities and optimize handoffs.
  4. **Automation:** Implement RPA (using UiPath) to automate routine tasks (e.g., sending email alerts).

- **Results:**  
  - Reduced processing time from 5 days to 2 days.
  - Improved investor satisfaction scores by 20%.

## Methodology

The project followed a structured approach:
- **Data Aggregation:** Collected data from various systems (CRM, email, accounting) to create a unified event log.
- **Process Mapping:** Imported event logs into a process mining tool to generate a “digital twin” of the capital call process.
- **Bottleneck Analysis:** Identified key delays (notably during Finance approval and investor response phases).
- **Workflow Redesign:** Revised the process with clear ownership, defined SLAs, and parallel processing for certain tasks.
- **RPA Implementation:** Developed UiPath bots to automate sending capital call notices and tracking investor responses.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Integrated automated dashboards for real-time tracking and process optimization.

## Implementation Details

- **Tools Used:**  
  - SQL for data extraction  
  - Celonis (or Power BI) for process visualization and mining  
  - UiPath for robotic process automation

- **Key Steps:**  
  1. **Extract & Clean Data:** SQL queries were used to build a comprehensive event log.
  2. **Visualize Process:** Celonis mapped out process variants and highlighted bottlenecks.
  3. **Redesign Workflow:** A new process model was implemented with defined handoffs and automated alerts.
  4. **Deploy RPA:** UiPath bots were created to automate investor communications and update payment trackers.
  5. **Integrate & Monitor:** The process mining insights were continuously monitored and fed back into the operational workflow.

## Results & Impact

- **Processing Time:** Reduced from 5 days to 2 days.
- **Investor Satisfaction:** Increased by 20% (based on survey metrics).
- **Operational Efficiency:** Achieved significant reductions in manual effort, freeing up staff time for higher-value activities.
- **Error Reduction:** Automation led to near elimination of manual errors in notices and payment tracking.

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

- **Data Quality & Integration:** Ensuring complete and clean data was critical.
- **Change Management:** Securing stakeholder buy-in was key to overcoming resistance.
- **Handling Exceptions:** A phased approach to automation allowed room for adjustments.
- **Technical Integration:** Aligning Celonis and UiPath required custom configurations and vendor support.

These challenges provided valuable lessons for future process mining and automation projects.

## Future Scope & Recommendations

- **Extend Process Mining:** Apply the same methodology to other operational areas such as investor onboarding, KYC, and distribution processes.
- **Advanced Automation:** Incorporate OCR and machine learning to further automate document processing and predictive analysis.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Maintain a dashboard-driven review cycle to catch new bottlenecks early.
- **Governance:** Establish a process mining Center of Excellence to drive continuous process optimization.
